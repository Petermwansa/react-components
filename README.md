### ABOUT THE APP 

This is a simple React App that utilises the functgionality of components and why they are an important part of react.
Basically, all React apps are created using components.
This makes it more easier and to write application and economical since you can reuse components therefore, saving up time.


### TOPICS COVERED.

In this project the main focus is the use of components 
I have also included the topic of props which I will cover in depth in another repository.
There is also the concept of exporting and and importing data across different components,
this is demonstrated together with props by importing the data to be parsed to the cards from a different javaScript file# react-components
